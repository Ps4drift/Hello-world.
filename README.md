Regulators! Mount up! 

I have traversed the darker corners of the web, read guides, watched youtube videos in quest to make a stream that dosent suck. 
Am I the hero in this adventure or the fool. I'm hoping for both. 

I aimm to use this site, to collect an store immages, videoes important notes and possibly mmy lunch if possible.
